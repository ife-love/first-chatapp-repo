<p> This would be my first mini project as a junior full stack web developer in training and the step by step guides on how I was able to carry out this project with the help of my instructor and some online materials will be documented!</p>

# Introduction

The idea is to create an application similar to discord / Search engine, where different chat rooms can be created for different people to learn about different topics and interact with one another.

# Technologies/Tools
<hr>
Project is created with:
+ Django version: 4.1
+ Python version: 3.10.2
+ JavaScript
+ Bootstrap 5
+ Cascading Style Sheets(CSS)
+ Hypertext Markup Language(HTML)

# Setup

Make sure you have a good version of Python on your computer, after creating a virtual environment, download django. Using the *django-admin startproject yourprojectname* command, create your project
Next, run the following command to create the application that will live inside your project

This app is based on @Dennis Ivy's youtube course/tutorial called Figma(StudyBuddy)
Although I will be using bootstrap for my themes just to practice what I've learned about bootstrap so far.
